        <div class="text">
            <p>
                In our daily life, it has helped us by improving our communication. With the help of technology, we have
                access to news, information,messages from users from all over the world. The access to information has
                become very easy and vast. Due to help of technology, we also have a very advanced lifestyle. If we
                compare our lifestyle to how life was for the people in the past who were living without technology, we
                can see that we definitely have it easy in a lot of different sectors. Likewise, in the field of
                business as well, technology plays a very vital role. Businesses all over the world can grow better with
                the help of technology. Technology gives access to consumers all over the world to have a look at
                businesses all over the world. To enhance a business, technology is the main factor assisting it. There
                are a lot of businesses all over the world. If we take an example of a single sector of business, like
                of food, there are a lot of companies. The competition in that field is pretty tough. Not every business
                in that sector can be successful. But with the help of technology, a business can definitely be more
                efficient. Lets take an example: There are a lot of companies all over the world that produce sodas/soft
                drinks. Among them, CocaCola is one of the most renowned companies in this sector. One of the reasons
                that the Coca-Cola company is so successful is because of the right use of technology in order to
                globalize its brand. Globalization is in fact another facility of technology that helps the business to
                attain a greater reach. Through proper research with the help of technology, the company was able to
                create skillful advertisements and create proper partnerships with bottling companies and distributors
                all over the world that helped it to be known so much.

                things that the advancement in technology has degraded. People have less privacy because of having
                access to the advanced technologies online and offline. People who are addicted to the use of electronic
                devices have to suffer various physical and mental issues in the long run. Because of the extreme
                increase in the use of mobile phones, internet among teenagers it has affected their social skills
                issues as well and reduced creativity too. One of the creations of technology, social media, is
                something that has become an integral part in most peopleâ€™s lives. The use of social media among people
                has increased alot. It has also increased a lot of crimes happening online. Social media is very
